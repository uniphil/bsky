      <h1>consuming the firehose for less than $2.50/mo*</h1>
      <p>2024-11-13 by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bad-example.com" target="_blank" title="bluesky profile: bad-example.com">phil</a> <small>(they/them)</small></p>

      <p><em>work in progress</em></p>

      <p>It's fun to play with data<sup>[citation needed]</sup>. All data on Bluesky is extremely public, and with 15 million users (as of today and with mind-boggling growth), there's a lot of public data to play with.</p>

      <p>You can get the firehose as a websocket JSON feed with <a href="https://jazco.dev/2024/09/24/jetstream/">Jetstream</a>. This connects you to <em>everything</em> happening on the network in real time. It's extremely easy to get started and very fun.</p>

      <p>Here's a random word from every post being posted <em>right now</em>:</p>

      <p><button class="feed-me">Connect firehose</button> <span class="the-word"></span></p>

      <p>There you go, you just consumed it for free from your browser.</p>

      <h2>little app</h2>

      <p>After noodling around a bit, i sketched out <a href="https://deletions.bsky.bad-example.com/" target="_blank">this questionable little app</a> which listens for all <code>delete</code> events from the firehose, and then shows the just-deleted text one last time in an anonymized disappearing feed. Kind of fascinating to see what people choose to delete. (also please note that I made this millions of users ago when the network was a fraction of the current chaotic speed). Maybe I'll write more about it later.</p>

      <p>Anyway it runs on fly:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fly machine, shared-cpu-1x with 256MB RAM: $1.94/mo</li>
        <li>2GB Persistent volume: $0.30/mo</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="./fly-dash.png" alt="screenshot of fly.io dashboard showing app metrics over 7 days. network io has a daily cycle (growing since bsky is growing), cpu memory and load average are all flat, volume usage grows (backfill), then levels (steady state), then grows again (bsky growing)." />

      <p>Granted it's not doing <em>much</em>, but it's doing it happily on the smallest instance fly offers.</p>

      <p>What <em>is</em> it doing?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Receive every new create-post event from the <code>app.bsky.feed.post</code> collection</li>
        <li>Filter out empty posts, apply redactions to mentions and links</li>
        <li>Cache the clean text content on the volume in pebbledb, keyed by <code>did+rkey</code></li>
        <li>Every few seconds, do a range-delete on saved texts older than 48hr</li>
        <li>For every delete-post event, try to fetch the text from the cache, and if found, broadcast it to all current observers</li>
      </ol>

      <p>More interesting apps might not scale down this far, but some will.</p>
